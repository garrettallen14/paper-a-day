Invisible Influence
Artificial Intelligence and the Ethics of Adaptive Choice Architectures

2019

Abstract
    - AI (recommendation systems) are constructed based on information collected about our individual preferences, interests, aspirations, and vulnerabilities, with the goal of influencing our decisions
    - This invisible layer of technological mediation renders us deeply susceptible to manipulation
    - Absent a guarantee that these technologies are not being used to manipulate and exploit, individuals will have little reason to trust them


    - Highlights the significant power wielded by those who create these adaptive choice architectures and argues they have special ethical responsibilities.
