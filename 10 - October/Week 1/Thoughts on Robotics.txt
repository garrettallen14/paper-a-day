Some Thoughts on Robotics Startups

01 Oct 2024

Robotics Startups of the Past and Present
    - Not many big exits in robotics
    - Founders are good at building cool tech solutions, but not good at selling / monetizing that technology
    
    - US-based investorys fund companies founded by robotics experts
        - Vertically integrated, often manufacturing robots in-house, building their own mapping, localization, navigation, and cloud-based fleet management
        - Setting up their own direct sales channels
    - "Recurring revenue" via RaaS
    - Locus Robotics: 3rd party logistics experts

Robotics is not SAAS
    - RaaS is the new SaaS, but it's not
    - Robotics is capital intensive
    - Robots age worse than servers
    - Robot is just one part of the business / product
        - The starting point

    - "Hardware is hard" => Hardware is slow
    - Supply chains are better but still slow, inefficient

Robotics Ecosystems
    - If the current gen of robot startups are fully vertically integrated and founded solely by robotics people, what does the next gen look like ?

    - Domain experts in whatever problem the robot is solving

    - Healthcare automation, 3PL startups, etc...
    - Not fully integrated

Actionable Stuff
    - CEO: Domain expert in whatever industry selling into. Significant product experience. Able to sell -- CEO industry connections will take the place of hiring a sales team initially
    - CTO: Robotics expert, with product experience. CTO needs a solid grasp of hardware, web/enterprise software, and any other product specific technologies
