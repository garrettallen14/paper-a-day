the upper limit of intelligence

5 Oct 2024

Abstract
    - Sick of drawing plots w/intelligence going up forever
    - There are limits

The upper limit of intelligence
    - You cannot scale indefinitely
    - All exponential processes end
    - We make arguments about an upper limit of trained AI systems, based on resources, physics and thermodynamics of compute
    - That limit, without planet-scale upheaval, is about GPT-9 level (10**36 FLOP)
    - No concerns of ecosystem / climate on Earth ...
    - Hypothetical "terrestrial" superintelligence ... what about space ?

Factors
    - Energy: bounded by solar radiation on Earth and heat dissipation of plant.
        - Compute limiter
    - Compute: bounded by thermodynamics and tightly coupled w/intelligence
        - Intelligence limiter
    - Models: used to estimate intelligence output from compute input

Energy
    - Consider a few scenarios on a scale of increasing energy: E0 to E2:
        1. E0 = 40 GW (4 x 10**10) => current energy capacity of datacenters in US
        2. E1 = 10 TW (1 x 10**13) => scale of current global energy production
        3. E2 = 1 PW (1 x 10**15) => attainable power by covering most land mass with solar panels
    - Nuclear is discussed in more depth below, but main issue is heat dissipation
    - Solar doesn't increase the heat dissipation burden on earth from compute, so a nice source to draw from in the near term
    - Energy generation source doesn't matter for our calc, but if it exceeds E2 then heat dissipation problems => catastrophic heating of Earth

    - E2 calculation:
        - Assume: 20% efficiency (solar panel -> compute), 20% land can be covered
        - Simply calculate via land mass to get 1 PW ...

Limits of Compute
    - There are a variety of compute bounds
    - Earth's temp is a result of balancing solar irradiance and radiating heat into space
    - Using some other form of planetary wide energy would actually increase the temp
    - We're not inserting new energy into Earth, so temp is unlikely to deviate much from the current avg 290K
    - Landauer's Principle:
        - Experimentally verified compute bound that states erasing one bit of information in a computational process requires a minimum amount of energy: Emin = ...
    - At 300K, the minimum energy per bit operations is...
