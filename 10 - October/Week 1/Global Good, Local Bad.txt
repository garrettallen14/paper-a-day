“Global is Good, Local is Bad?”: Understanding Brand Bias in LLMs

27 Sep 2024

Abstract
    - Brand bias received little attention
    - Examine the biases exhibited by LLMs towards different brands, a significant concern given the widespread use of LLMs in affected use cases: product reccomendation and market analysis

    - Curated dataset across four brand categories, we probe the behavior of LLMs in this space
    - We find a consistent pattern of bias -- global brands -> positive attributes
    - Disproportionately recommending luxury gifts for individuals in high-income countries
    - LLMs are subject to country-of-origin effects which may boost local brand preference in LLM outputs in specific contexts


Notes:
    - Multiple choice answers
    - Almost guiding the answer out
    - Not aggregating, but simply measuring the bias which may be in the model towards XYZ brands...
