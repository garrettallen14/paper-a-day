TSPDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Learned Samplers
for Traveling Salesperson Path Planning Problems

Solving TSPPPs w/ TSPDiffuser:
    - Problem instance
    - Generate multiple paths via learned diffusion model
    - Connect paths to construct a roadmap
    - Perform path planning and solving TSP on the roadmap

Model Architecture:
    - We represent a TSPPP instance w/binary and distance images of obstacles and destinations
        - Stacked and encoded into a unified feature map
    - Noisy position data, concatenated with denoising timestep information and the feature vector extracted from the feature map, are fed into a diffusion model to reconstruct the original clean path
    - Learned DDPMs can generate clean data from complete noise N(0,I) by repeatedly applying the denoising kernel
    - For trajectory generation, reward (value)-guided sampling encourages generated samples to meet objective


TSPDiffuser:
Constructing Roadmaps w/ Learned Diffusion Models
    - Despite high generation capability, we observe two limitations:
        1. Sample generation is computationally intensive
        2. Even w/reward-guided sampling, there is no guarantee generated paths satisfy constraints imposed w/ TSPPPs
