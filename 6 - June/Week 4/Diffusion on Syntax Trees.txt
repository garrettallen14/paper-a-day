Diffusion On Syntax Trees For Program Synthesis

30 May 2024

Abstract
    - LLM generate code one token at a time
    - Their autoregressive generation process lacks the feedback of observing the program's output
    - Training LLMs to suggest edits directly can be challenging due to scarcity of rich edit data
    - To address these problems, we propose neural diffusion models that operate on syntax trees of any context-free grammar
    - Similar to image diffusion models, our method also inverts "noise" applied to syntax trees
    - Rather than generating code sequentially, we iteratively edit it while preserving syntactic validity, which makes it easy to combine this neural model with search
    - We apply our approach to inverse graphics tasks, where our model learns to convert images into programs that produce those images
    - Combined with search, our model is able to write graphics programs, see the execution result, and debug them to meet the required specifications
    - We additionally show how our system can write graphics programs for hand-drawn sketches


Intro
    - Iterative nature of diffusion naturally lends itself to search-based program synthesis
    - We train a value model alongside the diffusion model to guide the denoising process toward programs that are likely to achieve the desired output
    - This allows us to efficiently explore the program space, making more informed decisions at each step of the generation process
    
    - We implement our approach for inverse graphics tasks, where we posit domain-specific languages for drawing images
    - Inverse graphics tasks are naturally suitable for our approach since small changes in the code produce
    - We implement our approach for inverse graphics tasks, we posit domain-specific languages for drawing images
    - Small changes in the code produce semantically meaningful changes in the rendered image
    - A misplaced shape on the image can be easily seen and fixed in program space


Method
    - Develop a form of denoising diffusion models analogous to image diffusion models for syntax trees
