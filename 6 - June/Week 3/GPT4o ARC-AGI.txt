Getting 50% (SoTA) on ARC-AGI with GPT-4o

17 Jun 2024

Intro
    - Achieve 50% acc w/GPT-4o generating 8,000 implementations of transformation rules and selecting the best one
    - Use few-shot prompts w/step-by-step reasoning patterns
    - Perform revisions on some implementations after seeing what they actually output
    - Feature engineering to provide model w/better grid representations
    - Few-shot prompts for two main buckets of ARC-AGI problems (grid-size changes vs doesn't change)


Method
    - GPT4o generate 8k Python solution programs
    - Format problem as images and in various ascii representations
    - Similar to approach in AlphaCode, which generates millions of completions attempting to solve a programming problem, then aggregates over them to determine final submission

    - Provide image and also text representations showing which cells are occupied by different connected components of colors and showing diffs between input / output
    - Let 4o reason before all steps
    - 30k token prompt of step-by-step reasoning
    - Sample solutions
    - Select 3 submissions to make based on a majority vote over programs which get the examples correct
