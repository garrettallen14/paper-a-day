ENTROPY-SGD: BIASING GRADIENT DESCENT INTO WIDE VALLEYS

21 Apr 2017

Abstract
    - Entropy-SGD for training DNNs motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape
    - Local extrema with low generalization error -> large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues

    - We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions in the sharp valleys

    - Our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights
    - We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions


Introduction
    - Many directinos have nero-zero eigenvalues, positive eigenvalues have a long tail with largest being almost 40
    - Negative eigenvalues are directions of descent that the optimizer missed have a much faster decay

    - Wide valleys -> better generalization -> standard optimization algorithms find just this without being explicitly tailored to do so

    - We use SGLD to approximate the gradient of local entropy


Local Entropy
    - A simple intuition for the concept of local entropy of an energy landscape:
        - The discussion in this section builds upon results of baldassi 16a
        - Extends to case of cts variables
    - Log-partition function of modified Gibbs distribution

Effect on energy landscape
    - The negative local entropy F(x,lam) for two diff values of lam

    - Minimizing classical entropy does  not differnetiate between flat regions that have very high loss vs flat regions that lie deeper in the energy ladnscape


Entropy-guided SGD
    - Our Entropy-SGD algorithm minimizes the negative local entropy
    - The gradient of local entropy can be computed via Langevin dynamics
