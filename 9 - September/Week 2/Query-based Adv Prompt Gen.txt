Query-Based Adversarial Prompt Generation

19 Feb 2024

Abstract
    - Existing attacks work in the white-box setting, or through transferability
    - We improve with a query-based attack that leverages API access to a remote LM to emit harmful strings than with transfer-only attack


GCQ: Greedy Coordinate Query
    - Method:
        - Our main attack strategy is similar to GCG... makes greedy updates to an adversarial string
        - At each iteration, we perform an update based on the best adv string found so far, and after a fixed num of iterations, return the best adv example

        - The key difference in our algorithm is in how we choose the updates to apply
