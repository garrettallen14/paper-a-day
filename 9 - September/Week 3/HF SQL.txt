Introducing the SQL Console on Datasets

17 Sep 2024

SQL Console for Datasets
    - Every public dataset
    - 100% local: SQL Console is powered by DuckDB WASM
        - Can query dataset w/o any dependencies
    - Full DuckDB Syntax: Full SQL syntax support, along with many built in functions for regex, lists, JSON, embeddings and more
        - DuckDB syntax is very similar to PostgreSQL
    - Export results: Can export results of your query to parquet
    - Shareable: Can share your query results of public datasets with a link

How it works
    - Parquet Conversion
        - Most datasets on HF are stored in Parquet
        - SQL Console creates views for you to query based on your dataset splits and configs
    - DuckDB WASM
        - The engine that powers the SQL Console
        - An in-process database engine that runs on Web Assembly in the browser. No server/backend needed
        - Running solely in the browser -> user upmost flexibility to query data as they please w/o any dependencies
    - SQL Console memory limit is ~3GB
    - SQL Console can transform data into multi-turn dialogue format efficiently

    - Looks like this is all within the web window ?
