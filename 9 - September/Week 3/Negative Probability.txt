Negative Probability

Feynman

Abstract
    - If you combine quantum and relativity plus certain tacit assumptions, you can produce theories which give infinity for the answer to some questions
    - Infinities are kept in abeyance by the awkward process of renormalizaiton
    - We look into the "tacit assumptions" to see if they could be altered
    - One assumption: probability must always be a positive number.

Letter
    - Negative numbers are a fruitful invention
    - Negative probabilities => negative numbers
