Knowing When to Ask - Bridging Large Language Models and Data

12 Sep 2024

Abstract
    - We enhance accuracy of LLMs by integrating them with Data Commons, a vast, OS repository of public statistics from trusted organizations like the UN, CDC, ...
    - Explore Retrieval Interleaved Generation (RIG), with LLM trained to produce NL queries to retrieve data from Data Commons
    - RAG -> relevant data tables are fetched and used to augment the LLM's prompt

    - We evaluate these methods on a diverse set of queries, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving the factual accuracy of LLM outputs

RIG
    - Produces queries to execute to get correct answers, in NL
RAG
    - User prompts w/the RAG already there

Basically not a model release, but instead an evaluation of an approach
