Persistent homology: a step-by-step introduction for newcomers

Abstract
    - Rooted in topological data analysis, which allows for retrieving the essential topological features of an object
    - We provide an introduction


Introduction
    - Persistent homology is foundational tool for TDA


Background notions
    - We introduce the background notions at the basis of our work
Simplicial complexes
    - Classical way to represent discretized objects
    - Simplicial complexes: a collection of well-glued bricks called simplices
    - A k-simplex: the convex hull of k+1 affinely independent points
        - 0-simplex: single point
        - 1-simplex: an edge
        - 2-simplex: triangle
        - 3-simplex: tetrahedron
        - k-simplex: dimension => k
Homology and persistent homology
    - Simplicial homology is a powerful tool in shape analysis, providing invariants
