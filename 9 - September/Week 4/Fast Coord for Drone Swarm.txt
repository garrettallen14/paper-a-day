A fast coordination approach for large-scale drone swarm

17 Oct 2023

Abstract
    - Drone swarms will become commonplace
    - Fully autonomous vs controlled methods w/human participation
    - Large-scale drone framework is proposed firstly in this paper, which achieves global coordination through local interaction and reduces the impact of limited channel resources
    - Secondly, this paper proposes a local interaction-based fast coord method and introduces a prediction mechanism, to ensure that large-scale drone swarms can quickly achieve coordination even in the presence of node loss
    - The numerical integration method is used to update the consensus state, st the drones can increase the iteration period, reduce the number of packets, and further reduce the channel burden
    - Large-scale drone swarms are usually composed of drone swarms launched at different locations and times... a consensus algorithm considering the merging behavior of drone swarms is also proposed

    - The simulation results show that the large-scale drone swarm using the proposed architecture can achieve the leader-follower consensus in  a short time and even in a confrontational environment with poor communication conditions

    - Besides, after the merger of multiple drone swarms, the consensus problem can still be solved in very few iteration cycles


Introduction
    - Due to limitations of payload / energy of each drone, the deployment of swarms is proposed
    - Swarms perform missions collaboratively and have the potential of fast deployment and wild coverage to go beyond the individual capabilities of single drones

    - In a swarm, the drone acts as a simple agent and is conjoined in a complex networking system, giving rise to collaborative or collective behaviors
    - A drone swarm usually operates in a centrally controlled / self-organized manner

    - In centrally controlled drone swarm, a drone / ground station makes decisions and assigns instructions to the drones in the swarm
    - The Crazyswarm are centrally controlled by a single computer
    - In self-organized swarm, drones achieve task goals and make collective decisions by sharing information

    - Onboard monocular cameras / onboard audio-based localization systems achieve distributed information sharing for drones

    - Perception, decision, action loops
        - Communication and networking are crucial, as they enable information, including sensed data and decision instructions, to be disseminated in the drone swarm
    - As swarm sizes grow, timely and effective communication becomes challenging due to the contention overhead, and congestion.
    - Consequently, a centralized control mode only guarantees timely instruction and sensed data distribution for small-scale drone swarms

    - Self-organized tobot swarms involving drone swarms that use local interaction to produce global behaviors hold great promise
    - Some proposals have demonstrated successful implementations of self-organized robot swarms up to 1000 units

    - Meanwhile, small-scale self-organized robot swarms have also received increasing scientific interest
        - SWARM-BOTS presents a drone swarm with 6 tiny quadrotors autonomously exploring an unknown environment and back to the departure point

    - We propose:
        - A working architecture for large-scale drone swarm to achieve global consensus
            - Local interaction + consensus
            - Prioritizing the perception-decision-action cycle over reliable information transmission
        - The architecture can effectively address the problem of lack of channel resources that arise from an increasing num of drones
        - A fast coordination method for large-scale drone swarms in a confrontational environment with packet loss and dynamic topology
        - The delay problem is addressed by introducing a prediction mechanism
        - Considering the Zeno phenomenon in existing event-triggered consensus methods, we use Runge-Kutta to discretize the consensus algorithm for continuous systems
            - Increase the iteration period, reduce the num of packets, and lighten channel burden
        - A robust and time-limited algorithm is proposed to ensure consensus during the merging process of large-scale multiple drone swarms
