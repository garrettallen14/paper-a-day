Evaluating Class Membership Relations in Knowledge Graphs using LLMs

25 Apr 2024

Abstract
    - KGs have class membership relations, assigning entities to a given class
    - Propose a new method for evaluating the quality of these relations 
        - Process descriptions of a given entity and class using zero-shot CoT classifier w/ NL intensional definition of a class
    - We evaluate the method w/Wikidata and CaLiGraph + 7 LLMs


Preliminaries
    - Knowledge graphs:
        - I an infinite set of IRIs, B infinite set of blank nodes, L infinite set of literals
        - Knowledge graph G is a set of triples {(s,p,o) | sinS, pinP, oinO}
            - S set of subjects, P set of properties, O set of objects
        - A class is an entity that represents a set of entities sharing common properties / relationships in G


Experiments
    - Q: Can classifiers exhibit good alignment w/KGs?
    - Q: Can classifiers detect missing / incorrect relations?

    - Input: pair of classes c,d from G | (c, subClassOf, d) in G
    - Output: confusion matrix M
