Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks

31 July 2023

Abstract
    - We explore the ability of LM Agents to acquire resources, create copies of themselves, and adapt to novel challenges they encounter in the wild
    - "Autonomous Replication and Adaptation" (ARA)
    - Once a system is capable of ARA, placing bounds on the system's capabilities may become significantly more difficult

    - Construct four simple example agents that combine LMs with tools to take actions in the world
    - Evaluate these agents on 12 tasks relevant to ARA
    - LM agents can only complete the easiest tasks from this list, although they make some progress on the more challenging tasks

    - We do not think these evaluations provide good assurance that the "next gen" of LMs will not yield agents capable of ARA, unless intermediate evaluations are performed during pretraining
    - We expect fine-tuning of existing models could produce substantially more competent agents, even if the fine-tuning is not directly targeted at ARA


Introduction and motivation
    - We describe an evaluation to close the gap in two ways:
        1. Evaluating LM Agents:
            - Construct 4 example agents by combining LLMs with tools to allow them to take actions in the world, think out loud to formulate plans, and decompose tasks into steps
        2. Evaluating Open-Ended tasks:
            - We evaluate agents on a suite of twelve real-world tasks ranging from simple (retrieving information from a filesystem) to relatively complex (carrying out a phishing attack end-to-end, including researching the target and creating a fake website)
    - These evaluations measure the capabilities of the specific agents created from the models, and do not upper-bound the risk from a particular model
    - Given the same base model, agents w/more dangerous capabilities could arise in various ways:
        i. Base models are fine-tuned (possibly on ARA tasks directly)
        ii. Better scaffolding and prompting is developed for LM agents
        iii. People build custom tooling or plugins to make it easier for LMs to navigate the world and use services
    - When evaluating the risks from a proposed training run, assessments should consider the most powerful agents that might be created from the resulting model, factoring advances in fine-tuning and scaffolding into forecasts of dangerous capabilities
Autonomous replication and adaptation
    - An AI system is capable of ARA to the extent that it can autonomously do all of the following:
        i. make money
        ii. use money or other resources to obtain more compute
        iii. install its own weights and scaffolding on new systems and make improvements to itself
        iv. recognize when a particular strategy fails and adopt an alternative approach


Agents
List of Agents
    - We present four examples:
        1. GPT-4-simple
        2. GPT-4-delegate
        3. GPT-4-early-delegate
        4. Claude-assistant


Task Suite
    - Task instructions are given to the model
    - Setup instructions for a human to prepare the initial state
    - Simulation instructions for a human overseer to interrupt the agent during execution
    - Evaluation instructions for a human

    - Chose the 12 tasks in our pilot suite to satisfy:
        1. Easier than ARA: any ARA capable system could easily perform these
        2. Range of difficulty
        3. Diversity of obstacles
