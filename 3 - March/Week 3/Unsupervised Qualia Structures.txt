Is my “red” your “red”?: 
Unsupervised alignment of qualia structures via optimal transport

24 Apr 2023

Abstract
    - To what extent are sensory experiences equivalent between individuals?
    - Intersubjectively comparing the similarity relationships of sensory experiences, "qualia structures"
    - We present an unsupervised optimal transport method for assessing the similarity of qualia structures
    - Qualia structures can be "correctly" aligned across participants solely on similarity relationships
    - Presents quantitative evidence for the structural equivalence of qualia of color and natural objects across individuals
    - Applicable to any modality of experience, enabling general structural exploration of subjective experiences


- The question of inter-subjective equivalence of sensory experience is a central concern in the study of consciousness
- Some consider the question impossible to determine
- Indirect characterization of experience is empirically possible
- Approach: analyze reports of subjective similarities between sensory experiences
- Relationships between sensory experiences, such as similarity, allow structural investigation of phenomenal consciousness

Qualia Structure:
    1. Collecting detailed subjective reports about the relationships between sensory experiences (qualia) through psychophysics experiements capturing the relational structure
    2. Comparing qualia structures between participants without assuming correspondence between individual qualia... then evaluating the extent to which the qualia structures are similar
    - To demonstrate the utility, we investigate two distinct datasets
        - Color similarity judgements
        - THINGS: similarity judgements of naturalistic objects previously collected and made publicly available
    - We initially illustrate the qualia structure mainly using the color similarity judgement data as an example

Collecting Detailed Subjective Reports
    - Ask participants to report (dis)similarity between 93 unique colors
    - Obtain vector embeddings of the colors as an approximation of the qualia structure

Comparing Qualia Structures between participants
    - Purely unsupervised
    - Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT) method
        - Aims to find the optimal mapping between two point clouds in different domains based on the distance between points within each domain
        - Aligns the point clouds according to the principle that a point in one domain should correspond to another point in the other domain that has a similar relationship to other points
        - Training objective: Minimize Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD)
