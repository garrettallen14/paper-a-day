TubeR: Tubelet Transformer for Video Action Detection

10 May 2022

Abstract
    - Spatio-temporal video action detection
    - Directly detect an action tubelet in a video by simultaneously performing action localization and recognition from a single representation
    - TubeR learns a set of tubelet-queries and utilizes a tubelet-attention module to model the dynamic spatio-temporal nature of a video clip
        - Reinforces the model capacity compared to using actor-positional hypotheses in the spatio-temporal space
    - For videos containing transitional states or scene changes, we propose a context aware classification head to utilize short-term and long-term context to strengthen action classification
    - Use an action switch regression head for detecting the precise temporal action extent.
    - TubeR directly produces action tubelets with variable lengths and even maintains good results of long video clips


Introduction
    - This paper tackles the problem of spatio-temporal human action detection
    - Two approaches in the literature:
        - Frame-level detection
        - Tubelet-level detection
    - Frame-level detect and classify the action independently on each frame
