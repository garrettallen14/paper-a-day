1. Where are we?
Thumbnail sketch of the Theory:
- There is no single, definitive "stream of consciousness".
- There is no central HQ, no cartesian theater where "it all comes together" for the perusal of a Central Meaner.
- Instead of such a single stream, there are multiple channels in which specialist circuits try, in parallel pandemoniums, to do their various things, creating Multiple Drafts as they go.
- Most of these fragmentary drafts of "narrative" play short-lived roles in the modulation of current activity
- Some get promoted to further functional roles by the activity of a virtual machine in the brain.
- The seriality of this machine is not a "hard-wired" design feature, but the upshot of a succession of coalitions of these specialists.

- The basic specialists are part of our animal heritage.
- These specialists were developed to perform animal instincts -> ducking, predator-avoiding, face-recognizing, etc...
- They are often opportunistically enlisted in new roles, for which their native talents more or less suit them.
- The result is not bedlam only because the trends imposed on all this activity are also the product of design.
- Some of this design is innate
- But it is augmented, and sometimes even overwhelmed in importance, by microhabits of thought that are developed by the individual, partly idiosyncratic


2. Orienting ourselves with the Thumbnail Sketch:
- In Baars (1988), he summarizes what he sees as a "gathering consensus" that consciousness is accomplished by a "distributed society of specialists that is equipped with a working memory, called a global workspace, whose contents can be broadcast to the system as a whole."

- In AI, there is an importance placed on narrativelike sequences.

- Many have remarked on the relatively slow, awkward pace of conscious mental activity, and the suggestion has long lurked that this might be because the brain was not really designed--hard wired--for such activity.
- Human consciousness might be the activity of some sort of serial virtual machine implemented on the parallel hardware of the brain

- Some claim the neural architecture the brain is a medium in which structures get built as a function of the brain's interactions with the world.
- It is with these built structures, more than the innate structures, that must be cited in order to explain cognitive functioning.

- The basic specialists (hordes of specialists) are attested to by many different theories
- The size, roles, and organization of these specialists is hotly debated
- Many hard-wired circuits exist in monkeys, etc
- One viewpoint: the mind is a coalition of semi-independent agencies (Gazzaniga and Ledoux 1978, Gazzaniga 1985)
- Another: Fodor (1983) has argued that large parts of the human mind are composed of modules: hard-wired, special purpose, "encapsulated" systems of input analysis (and output generation)
- Dennett doesn't like Fodor very much, calls him a bureaucrat.
