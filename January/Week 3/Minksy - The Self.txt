Ch 9 The Self
- What makes each Human unique?
- Each person presents a different set of appearances and abilities
- Some traits are inherited, some come from experiences, but we all end up with different characteristics
- We use 'Self' for the features/traits that distinguish us from others.

- Self also implies all our activities are controlled by powerful creatures inside outselves, doing the thinking / feeling for us.
- These are our selves / identities

- Dennett:
- "A homunculus is a miniature adult held to inhabit the brain ... who percieves all the inputs to the sense organs and initiates all commands to the muscles."

- The single-self view diverts you from asking about how your mental processes work -- makes it easier


9.1 How do we Represent Ourselves?
- How do people construct their self-models?
- Start by asking simpler questions about how we describe our acquaintances: characteristics.
- However, characterisitics can change setting by setting. Or self by self.
- Ex: We have different representations for social self versus business self.

- Each of a person's mental realms may need different kinds of representations
- Whenever a subject becomes important to us, we build new kinds of models for it
- This ever-increasing diversity must be a principal source of our human resourcefulness...

- Suppose your car won't start... to diagnose what might be wrong, you may need to switch among different views of what might be inside the car:
- Depending on the issue, we may have to think in terms of: mechanical parts or electrical circuits, or create a model for fuel and combustion.

- To answer different types of questions, we need different kinds of representations.
- Example: if you wish to study Psychology, your teachers will make you take courses in at least a dozen subjects.
- Each of those subjects uses different models to describe different aspects of the human mind...
- Math: each subject has its own way to describe certain objects


We need Multiple Models of Ourselves
- What kinds of models might people use when they try to think about themselves?
- Commonly: body vs mind
- Body then grows into neck, head, torso, arms, legs
- Mind then grows into memories, feelings, goals, ideas

- Any model someone makes will only serve well in a certain situation
- We end with different views of ourselves to use in different realms, in which each person has different goals and capabilities
- When we think about ourselves, we'll need ways to rapidly switch among different models we've made of ourselves

- Any single model that tried to represent all this would soon become too complex to use.
- In each of those various realms of life, the models that we make for ourselves will portray us as having had somewhat different autobiographies: pursuing different aims and ideals

- Multiple Models of Self: Intellectual, Athletic, Professional, Spiritual, Familial, .......

- Dennett: "... we are all virtuoso novelists, who find ourselves engaged in all sorts of behavior, and we always try to put the best "faces" on if we can. 
- We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story. And that story is our autobiography. The chief fictional character at the center of that autobiography is one's self."


Multiple Sub-Personalities
- When Joan is with a group of her friends, she regards herself as fairly sociable. But when surrounded by strangers, she sees herself as anxious, reclusive, and insecure.
- We each make different self-models to use in different kinds of contexts and realms

- Each person has a variety of 'sub-personalities', each of which may have some control over different sets of resources and goals
- Each has somewhat different ways to think

- *** All of one's sub-personae will generally share most of one's skills and bodies of commonsense knowledge.
- Conflicts among those sub-personalities can lead to problems because some of them might make rash decisions, while others might try to take over and maintain control.

- Suppose Joan is working her professional job, but suddenly some social part of her mind reminds her of a time when she was trapped in an awkward relationship.
- She tries to shake off those memories, only to find herself thinking in childish ways about how her parents would view her present behavior...
- Her thoughts might oscillate among such varying self-images as:
- A partner in a business,
- A person who likes to do research,
- One with a certain collection of values,
- A member of a family,
- A person involved in a love affair,
- A person having a pain in her knee...

- When Joan needs to make a decision, the result will partly depend upon which sub-personalities are active then.
- Business self: what is most profitable; Ethical self: select the answer that suits her ideals 'best';

- Each major change in emotional state may display a different sub-personality (someone falls in love and becomes a different person (they see things differently))

- When we switch our sub-personalities, we change our ways to think
- Some of these shifts will be transiently brief, while others will be more persistent—but in each case, the sub-personality that is now in control will influence the views and goals that you use and pursue

The Sense of Personal Identity
- your ‘contents’ keep changing moment to moment
- Nevertheless over months and years, enough of your knowledge remains the same—and different enough from anyone else’s—that we recognize your stability
- our ‘identities’ are mainly what’s in our memories

- A mind is an assembly of parts that each performs different activities. 
- Each may have conflicting concerns and goals, which sometimes can only be resolved by turning off some participants.

- Question you must ask: which of your models of yourself would best serve your present purposes.


9.2 Personality Traits
- Descriptions are filled with everyday words that name what we call “character traits” or “characteristics”
- Ex. disciplined, honest, attentive, and friendly
- Why should minds so complex as ours show any clear-cut characteristics? Why should personal traits exist at all?

- Some possible causes:
1. Inborn Characteristics
2. Investment Principle: Once we learn an effective way to do some job, we’ll resist learning other ways to do it
3. Archetypes and Self-Ideals: Every culture comes with myths that describe the fates of beings that are endowed with larger-than-life traits. Few of us can prevent ourselves from becoming attached to those heroes and villains.
4. Self-Control: It is hard to achieve any difficult goals unless you can make yourself persist at them.
5. Stereotyping: Whenever we encounter something, we assume ‘by default’ that it must be like other things that it reminds us of.

- Perhaps the easiest way to describe a thing is by making a simple list of its properties.
- Thus, we can describe a child's building block as being rectangular, heavy, and made out of wood...
- Similar: it is easy to say that a person is honest and tidy—as opposed to being deceitful and sloppy. However, of course, no person always tells the truth, or keeps everything perfectly neat. 
- Nevertheless, it can save a great deal of effort and time to see people or things as stereotypes—by assuming their properties by default.

- Many people are amazed that a stranger could see so deeply inside of them—yet every one of those statements applies, to some extent, to everyone!
- But perhaps the simplest reason why such assessments may seem correct to us is that we each maintain so many self-models that almost any statement about ourselves will agree with at least some of those models.

Self Control
- It is hard to achieve any difficult goals unless, at least to some extent, you can make yourself persist at them.
- You would never complete any long-range plans if, whatever you tried, you kept “changing your mind.”
- However, you cannot simply ‘decide’ to persist, because many kinds of events may later affect your goals and priorities.
- Consequently, we each must develop ways to impose less breakable self-constraints on ourselves.

- You must make yourself predictable for your friends, so they can depend on you.
- You must also be able to depend on yourself to carry out at least some of your plans.
- You need ways to restrict yourself.

- Our cultures help us to acquire such traits by teaching us to admire: consistency, commitment, ambitiousness.
- If you admire these traits, you may make it your goal to train yourself to behave in these ways.

- It is hard to make yourself do things that do not interest you
- Unless you have enough self-control, the Rest of Your Mind will find more attractive alternatives.

- We sometimes control ourselves by making bribes or threats to ourselves in the forms of self-incentives like, "If I fail, I'll be ashamed of myself,"
- To do this requires some knowledge about which such methods will work on ourselves

- It seems the techniques we use for self-control resemble those that we use to persuade our acquaintances (exploiting needs, fears, making promises of rewards, withdrawing access to things they want)

- You must play these devious tricks on yourself: else you would soon be dead if any particular part of your mind could take over control of the rest.

- Every culture develops ways to help its members constrain themselves:
- Every game that our children play helps to train them to assume new roles and to swiftly switch among those mental states, while still obeying the rules of that game, which, in effect, is a virtual world...

- Self Control is difficult, however we eventually accumulate techniques whose workings are so opaque to us that we can only use vague suitcase-words for them;
- Another meaning for self: all the methods we use whenever we try to control ourselves.

Dumbbell Ideas and Dispositions.
- Why do we find it so easy to say that a certain person tends to be extroverted and sociable—as opposed to being shy and reclusive?
- We often group our tempers, emotions, moods and traits into pairs that we regard as opposites.

- In early life, we start with mostly similar agencies on either side. 
- Later, as we grow more complex, a combination of genetic and circumstantial effects leads one of each pair to take control of both. 
- Otherwise, we might become paralyzed by conflicts, because many agents would have to serve two masters. 
- Eventually, the adult managers for many skills would tend to develop on the side of the brain most concerned with language because those agencies connect to an unusually large number of other agencies. 
- The less dominant side of the brain will continue to develop, but with more emphasis on lower-level skills, and with less involvement with plans and goals. 
- Then if that brain-half were left to itself, it will seem more childish and less mature because it lacks those higher-level management skills.

- Reasons we might like making two-part distinctions:
1. Many things seem to have Opposites: in early life, it is hard to distinguish what something ‘is’ without some idea of what it is not
2. Intensities and Magnitudes: it is hard to describe what feelings are, but it seems easy to say how intense they are.
3. Structural vs. Functional descriptions: Many of our distinctions are based on ways to make connections between what we learn about things and what we learn about using those things. 
- It is often convenient to classify the parts of an object as playing ‘principal’ vs. ‘supporting’ roles.
- A chair: the seat and back are its essential parts, and its legs and parts are merely serving to sustain them.
4. Inborn Brain-Machinery: why we tend to think in terms of pairs could be that our brains are innately equipped with special ways to detect differences between pairs of mental representations. 

- When is it appropriate to distinguish between only two alternatives?
- These can be useful when we only have two options to choose among.
- However, selecting what to remember or do will usually depend on making more complex decisions like:
1. How should we describe this event?
2. What links should we connect with it?
3. Which other things is it similar to?
4. What other uses could we make of it?
5. Which of our friends should we tell about it?

- It makes little sense to commit ourselves, for all future times, about which objects to like or dislike
- All such decisions should depend upon the contexts that we find ourselves in

- There is something wrong about more dumbbell distinctions
