Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity
Drew McDermott 1976

- AI has always been on the border of respectability, and therefore on the border of crackpottery.
- Our tolerance for sloppy thinking has led us to repeat many mistakes over and over.
- If we are to retain any credibility, this must stop.

- This paper is an effort to ridicule some of these mistakes...

Wishful Mnemonics
- A major source of simple-mindedness in AI programs is the use of mnemonics like "UNDERSTAND" and "GOAL" to refer to programs and data structures.
- However, in AI, our programs are problems rather than solutions.
- If a researcher tries to write an "understanding" program, it isn't because he has thought of a better way of implementing this well-understood task, but because he thinks he can come closer to writing the first implementation.
- If he calls the main loop of his program "UNDERSTAND", he is merely begging the question & may mislead a lot of people, including himself.
- Instead: refer to this main loop as "G0034" and see if he can convince himself that this implements some sort of understanding...

- GPS (Ernst and Newell 1969) = "General Problem Solver"
- Caused way too much hype/distraction
- Should have been called: Local-Feature-Guided Network Searcher.

- Be careful in using names and terms which sound too grand...

- As AI progresses, this malady gets worse.
- Example: Systems we label as an "understander"
- Many researchers have fallen into using simple connections like IS-A...
Ex: Happiness -IS-A-> State-of-Mind  can lead to suspiciously wishful networks like Greater-Than -IS-A-> Binary-Transitive-Relation...
- This is an illustration of "contagious wishfulness": because one piece of a system is labeled impressively, the things it interact with inherit grandiosity.

- A program called "THINK" is likely inexorable to acquire data structures called "THOUGHTS"
- A disciplined programmer will use gensyms in key places to see if he still admires his system.
- Ex. Happiness -INHERITS-INDICATORS-> G1073 looks far more dubious...

- Concepts borrowed from human language must shake off a lot of surface-structure duest before they become clear.

Unnatural Language
- More sloppiness: tendency to see in natural language a natural source of problems and solutions.
