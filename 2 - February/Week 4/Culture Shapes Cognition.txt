A Dialogical Account of Deductive Reasoning  
as a Case Study for how Culture Shapes Cognition

Abstract
    - Social, cultural practices may influence how humans reason
    - Will focus particularly on deductive reasoning and address the question of whether learned to be mastered or arise spontaneously in untrained reasoners.
    - Deductive skills arise predominantly by means of specific training, "schooling"
    - When it comes to deduction, the onset of deductive reasoning in an individual reasoner, recapitulates the historical emergence of the concept of deduction.

    - But games can cue untrained reasoners to perform closer to the deductive canons in experiments
        - This also implies some sort of training!


Introduction
    - Connections between argumentation (a cultural practice) and reasoning
    - Begin by presenting a philosophical reconceptualization of the concept of deduction inspired by its emergence in the context of specific dialogical practices in ancient Greece
    - Next, I discuss alternative accounts of the connections between culture, argumentation and reasoning... point out differences between my approach and these other proposals
    - I then review the experimental findings on deductive reasoning
