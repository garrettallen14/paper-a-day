SELF-DISCOVER: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures

6 Feb 2024

Introduction
    - Paper aims at self-discovering the underlying reasoning structure unique to the task
    - Highly efficient in terms of computation
    - From a set of atomic reasoning modules "breakdown into subtasks", "critical thinking"
    - Stage 1: compose coherent reasoning structure intrinsic to the task
    - Stage 2: solve instances of the task using the discovered structure
        - LLM simply follows the self-discovered structure to arrive at the final answer

    
Self-Discovering Reasoning Structures for Problem Solving
    - Humans use prior knowledge and skills to devise a reasoning program to solve problems
    - We often search internally what knowledge/skills from prior experiences might be helpful
    - Attempt to apply relevant knowledge and skills to the task
    - Finally, connect multiple individual skills and knowledge to solve the problem

    - Stage 1 uncovers the intrinsic reasoning structure for solving each task via meta-reasoning
        - We use three meta-prompts to guide LLMs to select, adapt, and implement an actionable reasoning structure
            - No labels or training required
        - Format the structure in KV pairs similar to JSON
        - Operates on the task-level, meaning we only need to run Self-Discover once for each task
    - Stage 2 we can simply use the discovered reasoning structure to solve every instance of the given task
        - Instruct models to follow the provided structure by filling each key and arriving at a final answer

Stage 1: Self-Discover Task-Specific Structures
    - Consists of three actions
        1. SELECT: relevant reasoning modules for task-solving are chosen from the set of reasoning module descriptions
        2. ADAPT: descriptions of selected reasoning modules are rephrased to be more specific to task at hand
        3. IMPLEMENT: adapted reasoning descriptions are implemented into a structured actionable plan
    SELECT
        - Not every reasoning module is helpful for every task
        - Select guides the model to select modules that are useful based on task examples
            - Ex. "reflective thinking" might help search for first-principle theories
                "creative thinking" helps generating a novel continuation of a story
                "critical thinking"
        - Self-Discover first selects a subset of reasoning modules Ds that are useful for solving the tasks
    ADAPT
        - Each reasoning module provides a general description of how to solve problems


SELECT: 
    - Select several reasoning modules that are crucial to utilize in order to solve the given Task.
    - Set of examples
    - (Select several modules that are crucial for solving the tasks above:)
ADAPT:
    - Rephrase and specify each reasoning module so that it better helps solving the task.
    - Set of examples
    - (Adapt each reasoning module description to better solve the tasks:)
IMPLEMENT:
    - Operationalize the reasoning modules into a step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format
    - Paired IMPLEMENT step demonstration...
    - Set of examples
    - (Implement a reasoning structure for solvers to follow step-by-step and arrive at correct answers)

Then it will go step by step and answer each question after the IMPLEMENTATION
Just call the LLM to generate a thing to answer the question
