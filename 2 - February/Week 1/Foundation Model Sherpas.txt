Foundation Model Sherpas:
Guiding Foundation Models through Knowledge and Reasoning

2 Feb 2024

Abstract
- Foundation Models have revolutionized AI with remarkable performance in various tasks
- Exhibit limitations preventing broader adoption
- No guarantee that the model's output aligns with user preferences
- Propose: conceptual framework by which agents could interact with FMs and guide them for a set of tasks, particularly through knowledge augmentation / reasoning
- The framework elucidates agent role categories like:
    - Updating the underlying FM
    - Assisting with prompting the FM
    - Evaluating FM output
- We also categorize several SOTA approaches into agent interaction protocols
- Provides guidance for future directions to realize the power of FMs in practical AI systems


Introduction
- We introduce a conceptual framework where agents/modules that interact with FMs behave as sherpas
- Sherpas guide FMs to tackle user-specified tasks
- Sherpas can leverage knowledge and reasoning
- Framework emphasizes the roles played by various agents as they interact with FMs to pursue user-specified tasks

Agents and FMs
- We stress the autonomy of agents and do not regard tools/APIs to be agents (like langchain and autogen)


Agent Roles in the Sherpas Framework
- Input is provided to an FM, which is invoked to generate a completion
- Solving a task may require multiple FM calls
- May be opportunity to leverage external knowledge / reasoning via one or more sherpas

FM Updaters
- FM Updaters are sherpas that modify the underlying transformer
- Modified Pretraining
- Fine/Instruction tuning
