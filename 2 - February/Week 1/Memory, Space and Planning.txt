Memory, Space, and Planning:
Multiscale Predictive Representations

16 Jan 2024


Abstract 
- Memory intertwines with prediction and planning
- Behavior in agents is influenced by the interplay of learning from the past and predicting the future.
- Cognitive maps, representing the relational structure of experiences, are crucial.
- Memory structures are multiscale, predictive, and compact, located in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortex hierarchies.
- These structures facilitate recall of past episodes and generalization for prediction and planning.
- Insights have implications for understanding brain mechanisms and advancing AI systems.

Planning a Trip:
- You could consider the plan in exhaustive detail
- Could consider it in high-level by jumping over many steps
- Either way, you easily use representations of the world that are organized in your memory at multiple scales.

Central Thesis:
- We can move back and forth across representations of the world
- We can remember the past, and image and plan the future at different scales of abstraction
- These are crucial to the structure of memory and its use in prediction and planning.

- Question: what should these memory structures look like to enable planning and how do we study them?
- Learnt structures of events (spatial structure of an environment or relational structure of a social network)
- are organized in memory as predictive representations that are multistep and multiscale.
- Brain regions can organize the same memories with different predictive horizons or scales.
- The ability to navigate between different scales of abstraction in memory is essential for prediction and planning


Memory Structures for Planning
- What should memory structures enabling planning look like?
- How to study them?
- Structures of events and environments are organized in memory as predictive representations.
- These representations are multiscale and multistep, reflecting in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex hierarchies.


Cognitive Maps
- Cognitive maps: representations of latent relational structures facilitating efficient retrieval, planning, reasoning, and inference.
- The brain may store step-by-step maps for planning
- Alternatively, memory's representational structure might be multistep and multiscale, allowing for temporal abstraction


Temporal Abstraction
- As we navigate through the world, events leave traces in memory, leading to associations among closely timed events, enabling efficient planning and prediction.
- Activation of one event partially activates its successor, facilitating prediction based on temporal associations.


Model-Based vs. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
Model-Free RL (MFRL):
- Agent learns to associate states or actions directly with rewards and does not model the environment's dynamics.
- Caches the value of each state and action, based on past rewards and doesn't maintain any representation of the environment's structure
- Effective for simple tasks

Model-Based RL (MBRL):
- Agent learning a model of the environment's dynamics, understanding how actions lead to future states and rewards.
- It captures the transition probabilities between states (p(Sâ€™|S, a)) and the rewards associated with state-action pairs. This allows the agent to simulate future states and make decisions that consider long-term outcomes.
- Suited for complex tasks where planning and foresight are required
- Requires more compute and slower decision making

Successor Representation (SR):
- A hybrid approach that focuses on predicting future states based on current actions without explicitly modeling the entire environment.
- SR captures the expected future occupancy of states from a given state under a specific policy, effectively combining the benefits of both model-free and model-based approaches.
- More RL though


Experimental Tasks: Model vs Human
- How are memory representations structured for prediction and planning?

Role of Replay: Prioritized replay, especially as conceptualized in the PARSR model is key for adapting memory and planning in dynamic environments
