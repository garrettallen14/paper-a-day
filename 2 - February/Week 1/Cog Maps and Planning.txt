Evaluating Cognitive Maps and Planning in Large
Language Models with CogEval

25 Sep 2023

Abstract
- Many studies claim emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs
- Propose CogEval to evaluate cognitive capacities
- System to evaluate cognitive maps and planning ability

Introduction
- Analyzed if LLMs understand the latent structure of planning problems
- First, operationalized the latent ability (cognitive map and planning)
    a. latent structure of the tasks' environment
    b. domain
    c. multiple planning tasks

- Cognitive map: representation of latent relational structures that underlies a task or environment
    - Facilitates planning, reasoning, and inference in biological and artifical problems
    - Comes from rodents' ability to learn maze structures w/o rewards
- Why would LLMs plan with a cognitive map?
    - Suggestion: LLMs have learned representations, which are comparable to the hippocampus of the brain and its representations
    - LLMs are capable of event segmentation of narrative transcripts
    - SO: LLMs could extract and use cognitive maps, but their current failure in capturing cognitive maps could underlie failure modes in planning


Methods
- CogEval is a protocol for evaluating any cognitive capacity
    1. Evaluating latent constructs like cognitive maps and adaptive planning
    2. Operationalization with construct validity through unique experimental tasks
    3. Employing multiple tasks with varying conditions to robustly measure planning abilities
    4. Controlling for multiple factors to make informed inferences about abilities
