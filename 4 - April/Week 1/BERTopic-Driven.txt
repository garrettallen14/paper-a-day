BERTopic-Driven Stock Market Predictions:
Unraveling Sentiment Insights

4 Apr 2024

Abstract
    - Analyze sentiment of topics derived from stock market comments
    - Integrate this sentiment analysis with various DL models
    - Incorporating topic sentiment notably enhances performance


Introduction
    - EMH posits that stock prices consistently reflect the rational present value of a firm's expected future cash flows
    - The rapid evolution of stock markets has led to a proliferation of diverse investor types participating in these markets, alongside a growing number of financial anomalies that defy the tenets of the EMH
    - Numerous studies have highlighted that stock market participants are not entirely rational
    - Consequently, conventional theoretical models in behavioral finance are not competent sufficiently to comprehensively explain the influence of investor sentiment on the stock market

    - Some researchers have previously employed the LDA-POS model for stock price movement prediction
    - LDA, while a widely used topic modeling algorithm, relies on the BOW model and doesnt take into account word order information
    - NLP technologies have emerged as promising tools for contributing to stock prediction
    - BERT, with its ability to consider word order and context is better suited for sentiment analysis
    
    - This enables us to computationally analyze extensive volumes of subjective information extracted from online platforms
        - Establish a topic vector space for effective topic modeling, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our sentiment analysis in the realm of stock market forecasting
