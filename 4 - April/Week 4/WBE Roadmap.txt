Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap

2008

Concept of Brain Emulation
Little need for whole-system understanding
    - Amount of functional understanding needed to achieve a 1-1 model is small
    - Behavior is emergent from the low-level properties
        - If coherent oscillations are important for conceptual binding, and these emerge from low-level properties of neurons and their networks, a correct and complete simulation of these properties will produce the coherence
    - Cannot be achieved w/o some functional understanding
        - Need models/theories for recognizing what data is relevant, would provide data for developing and testing these further
Levels of Emulation and Success Criteria
    - A 1-1 material copy o fthe brain appears to achieve all criteria
    - Level 1:
        - Parts list: An inventory of all objects on a particular size scale, their properties and interactions
            - Low level neural structure, chemistry, dynamics accurate to resolution level
        - Complete scan: A complete 3D scan of a brain at high resolution
            - Resolution, information enabling structure to function mapping
    - Level 2:
        - Brain database: Combining the scan and parts list into a database mapping the low level objects of the brain
            - 1-1 mapping of scan to simulation/emulation objects
    - Level 3:
        - Functional Brain Emulation: Simulating objects in a brain database. Produces a substantial range of species-typical basic emergent activity (eg. slow wave sleep state or awake state)
            - Generically correct causal micro-dynamics
    - Level 4:
        - Species Generic Brain Emulation: The emulation produces the full range of species-typical emergent behavior and learning capacity
            - Long term dynamics and adaptation
            - Appropriate behavior responses
            - Full-range learning capacity
    - Level 5:
        - Individual brain emulation: Produces emergent activity characteristic of that of one particular (fully functioning) brain
            - Correct internal and behavior responses
            - Retains most memories and skills of the particular brain that was emulated
    - Level 6:
        - Societal Role-Fit Emulation: Fill and be accepted into some particular social role
        - Mind emulation: Subjective mental states (qualia/phenomenonal experience)
        - Personality identity emulation: Correctly described as a continuation of the original minds
Scale separation
    - May appear unlikely that a complex system with many DoF like the brain could be modelled with the right causal dynamics, without taking into account the smallest parts
    - Microstimulation of individual neurons can influence sensory decisions, showing that very small disturbances can scale up to behavioral divergences
    
    - State variables of complex systems can be quantitatively predicted when there is 'scale separation': when different aspects of the system exist on sufficiently (orders of magnitude) different scales (of size, energy, time, etc)
        - They can become uncoupled

    - When there is no scale separation, macroscale predictions become impossible without simulating the entire microscale

    - Key assumption: at some intermediary level of simulation resolution between atomic and macroscopic, there exists at least one cut-off s.t. meeting criteria 1a and 1b at this level of resolution also enables the higher criteria to be met

    - A simulation at a particular scale cannot be an emulation
    - The causal dynamics of the simulation is not internally constrained, so it is not a 1-1 model of the relevant dynamics.
Simulation scales
    - Molecular
    - Chemistry
    - Genetic expression
    - Compartment models
    - Whole cell models
    - Local network models
    - System models

    - Levels of emulation
        1. Computational module: "Classic AI", high level representations of information and info processing
        2. Brain region connectivity: Each area represents a functional module, connected to others according to a (species universal) "connectome"
        3. Analog network population model: neurons populations and their connectivity. Activity and states of neurons or groups of neurons are represented as their time-averages. Similar to connectionist models using ANNs, rate-model neural simulations and cascade models
        4. Spiking neural network: As above, plus firing properties, state, and dynamical synaptic states
        5. Electrophysiology: As above, plus membrane states, ion concentrations, currents, voltages and modulation states
        6. Metabolome: As above, plus concentrations of metabolites and neurotransmitters in compartments
        7. Proteome: As above, plus concentrations of proteins and gener expression levels
        8. States of protein complexes: As above, plus quaternary protein structure
        9. Distribution of complexes: As above, plus "locome" information and internal cellular geometry
        10. Stochastic behavior of single molecules: As above, plus molecule positions, or a molecular mechanics model of the entire brain
        11. Quantum: Quantum interactions in and between molecules

    - The amount of understanding needed to accurately simulate the relevant objects tends to increase radically for higher (low-numbered) levels: while basic mechanicsare well understood, membrane biophysics is complex and the computational functions of brain areas are likely exceedingly multifaceted

    - Low level simulations require massive quantities of simple information, whereas higher levels require a smaller amount of very complex information (content of mental processes)
    - Each level has its own characteristic size and time scale, restricting the required imaging resolution and simulation timestep
    - Required resolution for WBEs is estimated ~level 4-6
Forecasting
    - Analysing requirements for emulation at each of the levels provides a way of bounding progress towards WBE
    - It is likely possible to calculate the earliest point in time where there is enough resources to produce WBE on a given level at a certain price


Roadmap
Requirements
    - Three main capabilities required:
        1. Physically scan brains to acquire necessary info
        2. Interpret the scanned data to build a software model
        3. Ability to simulate this very large model
    - Requires the development of three supporting tech areas:
        1. Validation of scanning, scan interpretation, neuroscience models, implementation, and ways of testing success of WBE
        2. Significant low-level understanding of neuroscience
        3. Automating neuroscientific information gathering and experimentation
Linkages
    - Most of the capabilities needed for WBE are independent of each other, or form synergistic clusters
Roadmap
    - Phase 1: Developing the basic capabilities and settling key research questions to determine feasibility, level of detail and optimal techniques
        - Partial scans, simulations and integration of research modalities
    - Phase 2: Once the core methods have been developed and an automated scan-interpretation-simulate pipeline has been achieved, then first emulations are possible
    - Key milestones:
        - Ground truth models: biological "ground truth" is known and can be compared to scans, interpretations and simulations
        - Determining appropriate level of simulation: determining whether there exists any suitable scale separation in brains (if not, WBE effort may be severely limited)
        - Full cell simulation
        - Body simulation
        - Simulation hardware: special purpose
        - Organism simulation
        - Demonstration of function deduction: demonstrating that all relevant functional properties on a level can be deduced from scan data
        - Complete inventory: complete database of entities at some level of resolution for a neural system
        - Automated pipeline: a system able to produce a simulation based on an input tissue sample, going through the scan, interpretation and simulation steps w/o major human intervention
        - Partial emulation
        - Eutelic organism emulation
        - Invertebrate WBE
        - Small mammal WBE
        - Large mammal WBE
        - Human WBE
Uncertainties and alternatives
    - A successful emulation need not predict all details of the original behavior of the emulated system; it need only replicate computationally relevant functionality at the desired level of emulation
