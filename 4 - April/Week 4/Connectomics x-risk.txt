Connectomics seems great from an AI x-risk perspective

30 Apr 2023

Context
    - Is accelerating this technology going to increase the chance that our future transition to superhuman AI goes well?
    - We answer this question for connectomics: science of mapping how neurons connect to each other in the brain
TLDR
    - Improved connectomics technology seems very helpful for the project of reverse-engineering circuitry in the hypothalamus and brainstem that implement the "innate drives" upstream of human motivations and morality
    - Would NOT be very helpful for reverse-engineering the learning algorithms implemented by various parts of the brain, particularly neocortex. That is a good thing too
        - Would lead to knowing how to build AGI
        - Want to slow that progress down
    - Improved connectomics tech might open up a path to achieving Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) earlier than non-WBE AGI.


Background Considerations
The Race 1: Reverse-engineering cortex versus hypothalamus and brainstem
    - Theory: Parts of the brain are running large-scale learning algorithms (cortex, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum), while other parts of the brain are doing "other stuff"
        - Large-scale learning algorithms are more-or-less the "secret sauce" of human intelligence
        - The "other stuff" contains "innate drives"
    - Would be good to reverse-engineer the hypothalamus and brainstem first, then reverse-engineer the cortex and other large-scale learning algorithms second
    - We should mainly care about "how are reward signals calculated in the first place?"
    - Understanding the cortex is probably objectively easier than understanding the hypothalamus and brainstem
The Race 2: Reverse-engineering cortex versus wall-clock time
    1. If AGI is invented later, we have more time for alignment research
    2. If cortex is reverse-engineered later, it becomes more likely we'll get AGI via a different independent AI research program
    3. Many other aspects of the world will change over time
The Race 3: Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) versus other forms of AGI
    - Radical advances in connectomics would be essential for WBE
    - AI x-risk people treat the possibility of WBE before AGI as desirable but unrealistic
    - With a WBE, we kinda know what we're getting:
        - Prosocial person will become a prosocial WBE. AGI may have alien motivations
        - Reasonably smart person will become a reasonably smart WBE
    - If we have WBEs, what do we do with them?
        - Make lots of WBEs, speed them up, and have them spend many subjective centuries in cushy VR environments pondering the problem of AI alignment and deployment
        - Legalize WBE and ban any other form of AGI forever
        - Take WBEs as the starting point
    - Why unrealistic?
        - In the course of trying to do WBE, we would necessarily wind up understanding brain learning algorithms well enough to build non-WBE brain-like AGI
    - A radical advance in connectomics (every neuron and synapse in a human brain could be mapped), this is a start
    - If we have complete human connectomes on a hard drive, we could hope for a few years of exclusively WBE

    - Connectome is not enough for WBE
    - Lots of things are not captured by the connectome
    - Building brain-inspired AGI is infinitely easier than understanding the brain
    - Understanding the brain well enough to simulate it requires:
        A. Constraints derived from brain observations (connectomic data, lesion studies, neural recordings, understanding of how neurons work, etc)
        B. Normative ideas about what that part of the brain is designed to do
        C. Algorithmic understanding of how (B) might plausibly get done
        D. Enough person-hours to fit the previous three puzzle-pieces together


Connectomics
    - Advances in connectomics are only slightly helpful for better understanding the cortex learning algorithm
    - Super-helpful for understanding the hypothalamus and brainstem
    - Radical advances in human connectomics would at least potentially put WBE on the table
