Memory, Space, and Planning:
Multiscale Predictive Representations

16 Jan 2024


Abstract 
- Memory is inherently entangled w/ prediction and planning
- Flexible behavior in biological and artificial agents depends on the interplay of learning from the past and predicting the future in ever-changing environments
- These processes likely rely on learning the relational strucutre of experiences: cognitive maps
- Two key takeaways:
    1. These memory structures are multiscale, compact predictive representations
    2. These are crucial to the complementary functions of the hippocampus and PFC:
        - Enables recall of detailed and coherent past episodes, and generalizing experiences at varying scales for efficient prediction and planning.
- These insights advance our understanding of the brain's memory and planning mechanisms... hold significant implications for advancing AI systems


Planning a Trip:
- You could consider the plan in exhaustive detail
- Could consider it in high-level by jumping over many steps
- Either way, you easily use representations of the world that are organized in your memory at multiple scales.

Central Thesis:
- We can move back and forth across representations of the world
- We can remember the past, and image and plan the future at different scales of abstraction
- These are crucial to the structure of memory and its use in prediction and planning.

- Question: what should these memory structures look like to enable planning and how do we study them?
- Learnt structures of events (spatial structure of an environment or relational structure of a social network)
- are organized in memory as predictive representations that are multistep and multiscale.
- Brain regions can organize the same memories with different predictive horizons or scales.
