Preface
    - Interest in waves begins with linear wave theory by Airy in 1845
    - Higher order theories by Stokes in 1847, long wave theories by Boussinesq in 1872 and limiting wave heights by Michell and McCowan in 1893,1894
    - WWII => need for understanding wave initiation and growth due to winds, the conservative and dissipative transformation mechanisms occuring from the source area to the shoaling, and the breaking processes at the shore

    - Offshore drilling in 50s and 80s and production of petroleum resources progressed from depths of 10m to 300m
    - Coastal erosion

    - Wave energy => remote sensing has indicated the potential of defining synoptic measures of wave intensity over very wide areas with the associated benefits to shipping efficiency
        - Harvesting this energy is possible

Chapter 1 Introduction to Wave Mechanics
    - Waves => A manifestation of forces acting on the fluid tending to deform it against the action of gravity and surface tension, which together act to maintain a level fluid surface
    - It requires a force of some kind to create waves

Characteristics of Waves
    - Length + height and water depth over which they are propagating
    - All other parameters can be determined theoretically
    - Length: the horizontal distance between two successive wave crests
        - Related to water depth h and wave period T (time required for two successive crests or troughs to pass a particular point)
    - Coordinate axis to describe the wave motion is z=0, the still water line. The bottom of the wate body is z = -h

    - Due to shallow water nonlinearities, more than one sinusoid, all of the same phase, are necessary
    - Using one sinusoid has been shown to be reasonably accurate for some purposes
    - Lineary, small-amplitude wave theory: easy to use and lends itself to superposition and more complicated manipulations


Chapter 3 - Small-Amplitude Water Wave Theory Formulation + Solution

Introduction
    - Real water waves propagate in a viscous fluid over an irregular bottom of varying permeability
    - In most cases, the main body of the fluidmotion is nearly irrotational... the viscous effects are usually concentrated in thin "boundary" layers near the surface and the bottom.
    - Since water can be considered reasonably incompressible, a velocity potential and a stream function should exist for waves
    - Numerous assumptions must and will be made as the development of the theory proceeds

Boundary Value Problems
    - The formulation of a bvp is simply the expression such that a unique solution exists
    - First establish a region of interest and specify a diffeq that must be satisfied within the region
The Governing Diffeq
    - With the assumptions: irrotational motion + incompressible fluid, a velocity potential exists which should satisfy the continuity equation: ...
