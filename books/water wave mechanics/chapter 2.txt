Chapter 2 - A Review of Hydrodynamics and Vector Analysis

Introduction
    - If a continuous function f(x,y) is known at x, then it can be approximated at x + dx by the Taylor series
    - Through the use of the Taylor series, we can develop relationships between the fluid properties at two closely spaced locations

Review of Hydrodynamics
Conservation of Mass
    - In a real fluid, mass must be conserved
Surface Stresses on a Particle
    - The motion of a fluid particle is induced by the forces that act on the particle
    - These forces are of two types:
        - Surface forces: pressure and shear stresses which act on the surface of the volume
        - Body forces: act throughout the volume of the cube... gravity, magnetic and other forces
Hydrostatic Pressure
    - Fluid deforms continuously under the action of shear stresses
    - Occurs by the fluid's flowing
    - For a still fluid, there are no shear stresses / normal stresses must be present bc we know that a fluid column has a weight and this weight must be supported by a pressure times the area of the column
