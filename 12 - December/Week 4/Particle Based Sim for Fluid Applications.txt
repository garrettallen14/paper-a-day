Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications

2003

Abstract
    - We propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fuilds with free surfaces
    - Particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable
        - Reduces the complexity of the simulation
    - The particles can be used to render the surface of the fluid

    - We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction


Introduction
    - Computational Fluid Dynamics has a long history
    - Claude Navier and George Stokes formulated the Navier-Stokes equation which describes conservation of momentum, 2 additional equations (a continuitiy equation describing mass conservation and a state equation describing energy conservation)
    - Since those equations are known, a large number of methods have been proposed to sim

    - Here we propose a particle-based approach on SPH to animate arbitrary fluid motion
Our Contribution
    - We propose a method based on Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics to simulate fluids with free surfaces.

    - Stam and Fiume first introduced SPH to the graphics community to depict fire and other gaseaous phenomena ... then animate highly deformable bodies
    - We extend to focus on the simulation of fluids


Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
    - An interpolation method for particle systems
    - Field quantities that are only defined at discrete particle locations can be evaluated anywhere in space
    - SPH distributes quantities in a local neighborhood of each particle using radial symmetrical smoothing kernels

    - According to SPH, a scalar quantity A is interpolated at location r by a weighted sum of contributions from all particles:
        AS(r) = sum(mj Aj/roj)*W(r-rj,h) (1)
    - W(r.h) is the smoothing kernel with core radius h
    - Since we only use kernels with finite support, we use h as the radius of support in our formulation

    - If W is even and normalized, the interpolation is of second order accuracy (integral(W(r)dr) = 1)

    - Particle mass and density appear in Eqn (1) because each particle represents a certain volume Vi = mi/roi
    - Mass mi is constant throughout the simulation and the same for all the particles. The density pho i varies and needs to be evaluated at all time step

    - So, thru substitution into Eqn (1). we get for the density at location r:
        phoS(r) = ...

        ...

    - Inherent problems with SPH:
        - When using SPH to derive fluid equations for particles, these equations are not guaranteed to satisfy certain physical principles such as symmetry of forces and conservation of momentum


Modelling Fluids with Particles
    - Eulerian (grid based): isothermal fluids are described by a velocity field v, density field rho and pressure field p
    - The evolution of these quantities over time is given by:
        - Conservation of mass
        - Navier stokes (conservation of momentum)

    - The use of particles instead of grids simplifies our equations ...
        1. The number of particles is constant and each particle has a constant mass => mass conservation is guaranteed
        2. dv/dt+v*Dv on the left hand side can be replaced by the substantial derivative Dv/Dt

    - There are three force density fields left on the right hand side modeling pressure, external forces and viscosity
        - The sum of these force density fields determines the change of momentum of the particles on the left hand side

    - ai = dvi/dt = fi/rhoi
        - vi is velocity of particle i and fi and prho i are the force density field and density field evaluated at the location of particle i, respectively
Pressure
    - Application of the SPH rule to the pressure term -Dp yields: fpressure i = -deltap(ri) = -sum...
    - This force is not symmetric and can be seen only when two particles interact

    - Since the gradient of the kernel is zero at the center, particle i only uses the pressure of particle j to compute its pressure force and vice versa
    - Because the pressures at the locations of the two particles are not equal in general, the pressure forces will not be symmetrical

    - Different ways of symmetrization have been proposed

    - We suggest a very simple solution which we found to be best suited for our purposes of speed and stability fpressure i = -sum(...)

    - The computed pressure force is symmetric bc it uses the arithmetic mean of the pressures of interacting particles
    - Since particles only carry the three quantities mass, position and velocity, the pressure at particle locations has to be evaluated first
