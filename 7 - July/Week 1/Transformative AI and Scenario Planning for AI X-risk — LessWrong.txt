Transformative AI and Scenario Planning for AI X-risk

22 Mar 2024

Overview
    - TAI is a useful key milestone to consider for AI Scenario Analysis
    - It places the focus on the socio-technical impact of AI and is both widely used and well-defined within the existing AI literature
    - We briefly explore the literature and provide a definition of TAI
    - We examine TAI as a revolutionary, general purpose technology that could be achieved with "competent" AGI
    - We highlight the use of Task Automation Benchmark as a common indicator of TAI
    - We note that there are significant uncertainties on the time differences between when TAI is created, when it is deployed, and when it transforms society


Introduction
    - The treshold of TAI is a useful milestone:
        - Wide but well-defined scope
        - Focus on societal impacts
        - Lack of dependence on any specific form of AI


What is TAI?
    - Gruetzemacher and Whittlestone:
        - AI systems could have very large impacts on society w/o reaching human-level cognitive abilities
    - Karnofsky:
        - AI powerful enough to bring us into a new, qualitatively different future
    - Direct Approach:
        - AI if widely deployed would precipitate a change comparable to the industrial revolution
    - Maas:
        1. Form and architecture of advanced AI
        2. Pathways towards advanced AI
        3. General societal impacts of advanced AI
        4. Critical capabilities
    - We define:
        - TAI causes significant, irreversible changes broad enough to impact all of society
    - ASI and AGI generally refer to capabilities
    - We can achieve TAI w/o high level AGI
        - AI automates a large fraction of current tasks
            - Mass unemployment and possible economic chaos
        - Narrow AI revolutionizes energy production and distribution, resulting in an end to scarcity and poverty
        - A totalitarian state uses AI to defeat rivals and maintain and extremely stable dystopian regime
        - A malicious actor uses advanced AI to develop and distribute an incredibly virulent virus, killing nearly all humans


Revolutions, Competency and the Automation Benchmark
Revolutionary Technology
    - A subset of the broader category of "general purpose technologies"
        - Gen purpose: "Unusually pervasive use, tendency to spawn innovations, and large inherent potential for technical improvement"
    - Rev tech: "Support an especially fundamental transformation in the nature of economic production"
        - Domesticated crops -> Neolithic revolution
        - Steam engine -> industrial revolution
    - AI may be revolutionary through task revolution, and provide "near-complete" automation


Competent AGI
    - Levels:
        - No AI, Emerging (>= unskilled human), Competent (>=50%), Expert(>=90%), Virtuoso(>=99%), Superhuman
    - Rapid social change may occur once Competent AI is achieved, not just near total automation


The date that TAI is developed is not the date TAI transforms society, but it may happen fast:
