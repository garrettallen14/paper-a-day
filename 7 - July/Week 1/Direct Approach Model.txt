Direct Approach Interactive Model

31 May 2023

Summary
    - Present an interactive model for forecasting TAI
    - We present a simple extrapolative model of key inputs (algorithmic progress, investment, hardware efficiency)
    - Under default parameter values calibrated on historical estimates, the simple extrapolative model assigns a high chance of development of TAI by 2050
    - Current trends of algorithmic progress and copmute scaling, if continued, will likely lead to AI systems within several decades

    - Four user-adjustable components:
        - Investment in model training, hardware price performance, algorithmic progress, and compute requirements produced by the Direct Approach
    - Together they produce a probability of TAI being trained during each year
    - "Physical FLOP" -> of the total FLOP available during a given year
    - When the amount of physical FLOP is adjusted to account for algorithmic progress, we get an estimate of the amount of "effective FLOP"
        - The amount of physical FLOP that would be required to reach a given level of perfomance if algorithms did not improve
        - This effective FLOP estimate is compared to the FLOP requirements produced by the Direct Approach 
        - When # of effective FLOP exceeds those requirements, we consider TAI to have been achieved


Investment
    - Large-scale training runs has grown at between 26%-151% per year


Conclusion
    - We combine the estimate of physical FLOP with the previous estimate of the algorithmic progress multiplier to get the number of effective FLOP available by year
