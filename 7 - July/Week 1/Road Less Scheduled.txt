The Road Less Scheduled

30 May 2024

Abstract
    - Schedule-Free: no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum
    - Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging
    - An open source implementation of our method is available
