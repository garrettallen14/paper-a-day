INTRODUCTION TO SMART CONTRACTS

22 Apr 2024

What is a Smart Contract?
    - A program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain
    - A collection of code (functions) and data (state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain

    - Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account
        - They have a balance and can be the target of transactions
        - They're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed
        - User accounts can interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract
    - Smart contracts can
        - Define rules
        - Automatically enforce them via code

Digital Vending Machine
    - Snack: money + selection = snack dispensed
        - Logic is programmed into the vending machine

    - A smart contract, like a vending machine, has logic programmed into it

Permissionless
    - Anyone can write a smart contract and deploy to the network
    - Just need to code it and have enough ETH to deploy
    - Deploying a smart contract is a transaction, so you need to pay gas
        - Far higher for contract deployment

Composability
    - Public on Ethereum: open APIs
