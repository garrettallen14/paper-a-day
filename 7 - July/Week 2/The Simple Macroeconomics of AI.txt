Conceptual Framework
    1. Y = B(N)(summation(.))
        - This is the GDP measurement based on:
            - z task
            - sigma elasticity of substitution between tasks
                - <= 1 st tasks are gross complements
            - B(N) depends on N to capture the possible system-wide effects of new tasks
    2. Task production function:
        y(z) = labor_augmenting_coefficient * labor_task_specific_productivity_schedule(z) * labor_allocated(z)capital_augmenting_coefficient * capital_task_specific_productivity_schedule(z) * capital_allocated(z)
        - Capital and labor have different productivities in different tasks
        - In the same task, perfect substitutes''''
