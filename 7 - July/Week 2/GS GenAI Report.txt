GenAI: Too much spend, too little benefit?

25 Jun 2024

Abstract
    - Tech are set to spend +$1T on AI capex in coming years
    - Will this large spend ever pay off?
    - The tech isn't designed to solve the complex problems that would justify the costs

    - We explore whether the current chips shortage and looming power shortage will constrain AI growth
    - We still see room for the AI theme to run: AI delivers, or bubbles take a long time to burst


Title
    - Acemoglu MIT estimates only a quarter of AI-exposed tasks will be cost-effective to automate within the next 10 years
        -  AI will impact less than 5% of all tasks
    - AI adoption may not create new tasks and products
        - He forecasts AI will increase US productivity by only 0.5% and GDP growth by only 0.9% cumulatively over the next decade

    - GS Covello argues we need a return on our ~$1tn cost of developing and running AI technology
        - Skeptical that AI's costs will ever decline enough to make automating a large share of tasks affordable given the high starting point as well as the complexity of building GPU chips
    - He is doubtful that AI will boost the valuation of companies that use the tech
        - Efficiency gains would likely be competed away
        - Path to boosting revenues is unclear

    - GS Briggs is more optimistic
        - Gen AI will ultimately automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by 6.1% cumulatively over the next decade
        - Briggs acknowledges that automating many AI-exposed tasks isn't cost-effective today, but the large potential for cost savings should lead to more AI automation
        - Briggs incorporates both the potential for labor reallocation and new task creation into his productivity estimates

    - Rangan and Sheridan remain enthusiastic about AI's long-term transformative and returns potential
    
    - Chips will indeed constrain AI growth over the next few years
        - Shortages in HBM technology and Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate packaging


Interview with Daron Acemoglu
    - Differences in forecasts come down to the timing of the technology
    - AI technology will instead primarily increase the efficiency of existing production processes


Joseph Briggs addresses the AI productivity and growth debate
    - Baseline estimate implying as much as 15% cumulative upside to US labor productivity and GDP growth, following widespread adoption
    - Scenarios w/superintelligence or robotics estimate even more upside
    - Differences:
        - Acemoglu: GenAI will automate only 4.6% of total work tasks
        - 19.9% of all tasks are exposed to AI and assumes that only 23% of exposed will be cost effective to automate
        - We assume 25%ß

Covello:
    The idea that technology typically starts out 
    expensive before becoming cheaper is revisionist history. E-
    commerce, as we just discussed, was cheaper from day one, 
    not ten years down the road.

    - Bruh... this can't be right

    - Moore's law in chips only proved true because competitors to Intel, like AMD, forced Intel and others to reduce costs and innovate over time to remain competitive
        - What is the point here (?!?!?!?)

    - Nvidia has no competition !!

    - Nvidia may not follow that pattern, and scale in dollars is different, but the market is too complacent about certainty of cost declines!
        - Its not just cost declines brother!!!
            - Algorithmic + Unhobbling !!!
            - It was never just about the compute my friend !!!

    - Replacement of the power grid (???)
    - For example, we’ve 
    found that AI can update historical data in our company models 
    more quickly than doing so manually, but at six times the cost. 
    - Wtf are you talking about brother .... I thought you made bank at GS. were they really spending like $30 an hour for data imputing and thought that was the best they could do xD

    - In our experience, even 
    basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical 
    results.
    - Muh hallucination !!! durrrr

    - I struggle to believe that the 
    technology will ever achieve the cognitive reasoning required to 
    substantially augment or replace human interactions.
    - Yayyy <3 :)

    - Humans 
    add the most value to complex tasks by identifying and 
    understanding outliers and nuance in a way that it is difficult to 
    imagine a model trained on historical data would ever be able to 
    do.  
    - You don't need imagination to pave a road or lay bricks.

    - But eighteen months after the introduction 
    of generative AI to the world, not one truly transformative—let 
    alone cost-effective—application has been found. 
    - Retarded comment

    -  I don't think the technology is, or will likely be, smart 
    enough to make employees smarter
