ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE (EVM)

21 Jun 2024

Introduction
    - The EVM is a decentralized virtual environment that executes code consistently and securely across all Ethereum nodes
    - Nodes run EVM to execute smart contracts
    - Use "gas" to measure the computational effort required for operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network security

From Ledger to State Machine
    - 'Distributed ledger' is often used to describe blockchains like BTC
        - Enable a decentralized currency using fundamental tools of crypto
    - Ledger maintains a record of activity which must adhere to a set of rules that govern what someone can/cannot do to modify the ledger
    - Ex. BTC address cannot spend more BTC than it has previously received

    - Because of Smart Contracts, Ethereum is moreso a distributed state machine.
    - Ethereum's state is a large data structure which holds not only all accounts and balances, but a machine state, which can exchange from block to block according to a pre-defined set of rules, and which can execute arbitrary machine code

Ethereum State Transition Function
    - The EVM behaves as a mathematical function would: given an input, we produce a deterministic output
    - We will more formally describe Ethereum as having a state transition function:
        - Y(S,T) = S'
State
    - The state is an enormous data structure called a modified Merkle Patricia Trie
    - Keeps all accounts linked by hashes and reducible to a single root hash stored on the blockchain
Transactions
    - Cryptographically signed instructions from accounts
    - Two types of transactions:
        - Those which result in message calls
        - Those which result in contract creation
    - Contract creation results in the creation of a new contract account containing compiled smart contract bytecode
    - Whenever another account makes a message call to that contract, it executes its bytecode

EVM Instructions
    - EVM executes as a stack machine, with a depth of 1024 items
    - Each item is a 256-bit word, which was chosen for the ease of use with 256-bit crypto
    - During execution, the EVM maintains a transient memory which does not persist between transactions
    - Contracts do contain a Merkle Patricia storage trie (as a word-addressable word array), associated with the account in question and part of the global state
    - Compiled smart contract bytecode executes as a number of EVM opcodes, which perform standard stack operations like XOR, AND, ADD, SUB, etc.
    - The EVM also implements a number of blockchain-specific stack operations, such as ADDRESS, BALANCE, BLOCKHASH, etc
