SGLang: Efficient Execution of Structured Language Model Programs

6 Jun 2024

Abstract
    - We introduce SGLang, a system for efficient execution of complex LM programs
    - SGLang consists of a frontend language and a runtime
        - Simplifies programming with primitives for generation and parallelism control
        - Accelerates execution with novel optimizations like RadixAttention for KV cache reuse and compressed finite state machines for faster structured output decoding
    - Achieves up to 6.4x higher throughput compared to SOTA inference systems on various LLM / Multimodal Models
