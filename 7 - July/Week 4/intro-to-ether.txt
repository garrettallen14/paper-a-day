INTRO TO ETHER

17 May 2024

What is a cryptocurrency?
    - Medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger
        - Medium of exchange: Anything widely accepted as payment for goods / services
        - Ledger: a datastore that keeps track of transactions
    - Blockchain technology allows users to make transactions on the ledger without reliance upon a trusted third party to maintain the ledger

What is Ether?
    - ETH is the crypto used for many things on Eth network
    - The only acceptable form of payment for transaction fees
    - Ether is required to validate and propose blocks on Mainnet
    - Primary form of collateral in the DeFi lending markets
    - Unit of account in NFT marketplaces
    - Payment earned for performing services/selling real-world goods

    - Ethereum allows developers to create dapps (decentralized apps) which all share a pool of compute
        - Finite pool, so Eth needs a mechanism to determine who gets to use it
    - The ether cryptocurrency supports a pricing mechanism for Ethereum's computing power
        - When users want to make a transaction, they must pay ether to have their transaction recognized on the blockchain
        - Usage costs are "gas fees" and depend on the amount of computing power required to execute the transaction and the network-wide demand for computing power at the time
    - Even if a malicious dapp submitted an infinite loop, the transaction would eventually run out of ether and terminate, allowing the network to return to normal

Minting Ether
    - How new ether is created on Ethereum ledger
    - Underlying Ethereum protocol creates the new ether, and it is not possible for a user to create ether
    - Ether is minted as a reward for each block proposed and at every epoch checkpoint for other validator activity related to reaching consensus
    - The total amount issues depends on the number of validators and how much ether they have staked
    - The total issuance is divided equally among validators in the ideal case that all validators are honest and online
        - In reality, it varies based on validator performance
        - 1/8 of the total issuance goes to the block proposer
        - The remainder is distributed across the other validators

Burning Ether
    - Can be destroyed through 'burning'
    - Ether burn occurs in every transaction on Ethereum
    - When users pay for their transactions, a base gas fee gets destroyed
    - This, coupled with variable block sizes and a max gas fee, simplifies transaction fee estimation on Ethereum
    - When network demand is high, blocks can burn more ether than they mint, effectively offsetting ether issuance
    
    - Burning the base fee hinders a block producer's ability to manipulate transactions
    - If block producers received the base fee, they could include their own transactions for free and raise the base fee for everyone else
    - Alternatively, they could refund the base fee to some users off-chain, leading to a more opaque and complex transaction fee market

Denominations of Ether
    - Wei: smallest possible amount of ether: 1e-18
    - Gwei (giga-wei): often used to describe gas costs: 1e-9

Transferring ether
    - Each transaction on Ethereum contains a value field (specifies amount of ether to be transferred, denominated in wei) to send from sender to recipient
    - When recipient address is a smart contract, this transferred ether may be used to pay for gas when the smart contract executes its code

Querying Ether
    - Users can query the ether balance of any account by inspecting the account's balance field, which shows ether holdings denominated in wei
