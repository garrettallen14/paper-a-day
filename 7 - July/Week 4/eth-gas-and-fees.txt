GAS AND FEES

23 Jul 2024

What is Gas?
    - Unit of measurement of amount of compute needed to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network
    - We pay for computational resources w/ a gas fee
    - Gas fee is the amount of gas used to do some operation, multiplied by the cost per unit gas
    - Fee is paid regardless of whether a transaction succeeds or fails

How are Gas fees calculated?
    - You set the amount of gas you are willing to pay when you submit a transaction
    - By offering a certain amount of gas, you are bidding for you transaction to be included in the next block
    - Too little gas => validators less likely to choose your transaction for inclusion => may execute late or not at all

    - Too much => you may waste some ETH
    - The total gas you pay is divided into two components:
        - Base fee: set by the protocol
        - Priority fee: a tip you add to the base fee to increase attractiveness to validators
Base fee
    - Every block has a base fee which acts as a reserve price
    - To be eligible for inclusion in a block, the offered price per gas must at least equal the base fee
    - The base fee is calculated independently of the current block and is instead determined by the blocks before it -- this makes transaction fees more predictable

    - When block is created, the base fee is "burned", removing it from circulation

    - Base fee increases quickly preceding a full block, so it is unlikely we will see extended spikes of full blocks
Priority fee (tips)
    - Incentive to validators to include a transaction in the block
    - Wihtout tips, validators could just mine empty blocks, as they would receive the same block reward
    - Small tips give validators a minimal incentive to include a transaction
    - For transactions to be preferentially executed ahread of other transactions in the same block, a higher tip cean be added to try to outbid competing transactions
Max fee
    - To execute a transaction on the network, users can specify a max limit willing to pay for the execution
    - maxFeePerGas: must exceed the sum of the base fee and the tip
Block size
    - Each block has target size of 15 million

Why do Gas Fees Exist?
    - Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure
    - By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, we prevent bad actors from spamming the network
