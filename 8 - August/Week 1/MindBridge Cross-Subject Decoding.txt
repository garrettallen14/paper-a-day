MindBridge: A Cross-Subject Brain Decoding Framework

11 Apr 2024

Abstract
    - Brain decoding aims to reconstruct stimuli from acquired brain signals, primarily from fMRI
    - Currently, brain decoding is confined to a per-subject-per-model paradigm
        - Limits its applicability to the same individual for whom the decoding model is trained
    - This stems from:
        1. The inherent variability in input dimensions across subjects due to differences in brain size
        2. The unique intrinsic neural patterns, influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensory information
        3. Limited data available for new subjects in real-world scenarios
    - We present MindBridge, which achieves cross-subject brain decoding by employing only one model
    - Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigm capable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspired aggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism for subject-invariant representation learning

    - Notably, by cycle reconstruction of fMRI, MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis, which can also serve as pseudo data augmentation
    - Within the framework, we also devise a novel reset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject
    - Experimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images for multiple subjects, which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models

    - Furthermore, with limited data for a new subject, we achieve a high level of decoding accuracy, surpassing that of subject-specific models


Introduction
    - Human brain possesses the remarkable ability to encode the sensory stimuli that we encounter every day, making sense of our perceptual world
    - Brain decoding is the reverse process

    - A decoding model trained on one subject's brain can only be effectively applied to that same subject, and can not be applied to other subjects
        - High costs to model storage and training
    - Need: cross-subject bran decoding
        - One model to decode brain signals from multiple subjects and adapting to new subjects

    - This requires adequately addressing various substantial challenges:
        1. Size variability:
            - fMRI signals exhibit substantial size differences across subjects
            - Inherent variability in brain size / architecture
            - Need a flexible approach to handle this variability
        2. Diverse Neural Responses:
            - The intricacies of the brain extend beyond structural variations
            - The way each subject's brain processes stimuli is uniquely shaped by their experiences, biases and cognitive patterns
        3. Data Scarcity for New Subjects:
            - In real-world applications, it is highly cumbersome to acquire extensive fMRI data for new subjects if not infeasible

    - We devise MindBridge:
        1. Adaptive Signal Aggregation:
            - Brain activation is probably sparse and only neurons exceeding a certain threshold activate
            - We propose to use an aggregation function based on adaptive max pooling to extract the most useful information, and unify the input dimension of fMRI signals across different subjects
        2. Subject-Invariant Representation:
            - We extract semantic embeddings from disparate subject's fMRI signals by utilizing a novel cycle reconstruction mechanism
            - These embeddings are then translated and aligned within a consistent CLIP embedding space, facilitating a standardized interpretation across varying neural responses
        3. Efficient Adaptation Strategy:
            - To mitigate the data scarcity issue for new subjects, we introduce a novel finetuning method, reset-tuning
            - Transferable knowledge from cross-subject pretraining is held in the deep layers, while shallow layers are responsible for projecting diverse subject's fMRI signals into subject-invariant embeddings
            - Reset-tuning reset the shallow layers, but reuses the deep layers

    - MindBridge also incorporates:
        - Visual but also text captions as training data
        - Predict corresponding image and text embeddings to reconstruct more semantically faithful images
        - MindBridge opens new possibility to synthesize new brain signals using data from other subjects while preserving same semantic meaning by cyclic fMRI reconstruction

        - MindBridge not only bridges the gap among different brains, but also potentially augments the volume of available data

    - To verify our approach, we conduct experiments on the publicly available NSD dataset
    - The absence of common images across different subjects poses an additional challenge
