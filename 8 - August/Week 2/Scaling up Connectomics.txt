Scaling up connectomics: The road to a whole mouse brain connectome

21 Jun 2023

Executive Summary
    - Connectomics: aims to map brain connections at the resolution of the synapse
        - Synapse are nanometre-scale contacts that allow transfer of information between neurons
    - Changes in connectivity over lifetimes are thought to encode most of our learned experiences
    - Connection differences likely underlie a range of mental health issues
    - Connectomics occupies a crucial mid-level between the developmental instructions encoded in DNA and the dynamic processes of the brain
        - Brings us closer to understanding the relationship between (brain) structure and function
    - Connectomics began in 1970s w/a 15-year effort to reconstruct the synaptic wiring diagram of the 302 neurons of the nematode worm, C. elegans
        - Ahead of its time: methods to probe the behavioral significance of the connectome by recording and manipulating neuronal activity (optogenetics) only came in 2000s,2010s

    - Synaptic wiring diagrams are a necessary but not a sufficient resource for understanding brain function
    - Recent evidence in the fruit fly: whole-brain connectomics can have a transformative impact on neuroscience
    - Structural wiring diagram can reveal algorithmic principles of dynamic processes:
        - Memory formation
        - recall
        - spatial navigation

    - As brains become larger and more complex, a greater fraction of the behavioral complexity may reside in the wiring diagram
    - Drosophilia appears a better guide to the impact of future connectomes in larger animals

    - Neurons require nanometre-resoultion imaging
    - Connectomes are generated by electron microscopy (EM)

    - Road to mouse connectome is long -- 10k times longer than the fly based on the amount of neural wiring in each brain

    - Mouse brain: 10th of a teaspoon, but 500x larger than anything ever imaged by electron microscopy
    - The raw 3D image data would fill ~500k laptops

    - High-level conclusions:
        1. Whole mouse brain connectome would have a major impact on basic and translational neuroscience
            - Timescales and costs uncertain
            - Short-to-medium term: targeted investment to develop key technologies and strategies across the connectomics pipeline are still necessary both to de-risk the project and reduce uncertainty
        2. Whole mouse connectome should be a flagship goal on a 10-15 year timeline
            - Whole smaller brains should be stepping stones
        3. Will only be a handful of centers worldwide that could image a whole mouse brain, later stages could be distributed
        4. To maximise benefit, we need to enable connectome generation for many smaller subvolumes of mouse brain that have also been subjected to correlative imaging of neuronal activity or molecular labelling
            - "integrative connectomics"
        5. Most costly step: manual proofreading required to fix errors in the automatic reconstruction of neurons
            - Would take 100k person-years today
            - Include:
                - Accessible computational platform to lower the barrier of entry to contribute improvements in automatic segmentation methods
                - More extensive ground truth for existing volumes
                - Improvements in proofreading tools and strats


Introduction
What is connectomics?
    - Map brain connections and link them to the shape of every neuron
    - Map all connections in a brain or brain region

    - If the individual bases that make up DNA are the fundamental unit of the genome, then synapses are the fundamental unit of the connectome

    - We strictly focus on approaches where synapses can be resolved

    - Connectome mapping depends on acquiring and analysing high-res large-field-of-view images of the brain w/EM
A short history of connectomics
    - Worm:
        - 302 neurons w/synapses between neurons and muscles
        - Group collected serial ultrathin (~50 nm-thick) sections of metal-stained, resin-embedded nematode, and imaged all slices in a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
        - Multiple nematodes were employed to generate a 'canonical map' extracted from 5 specimens
            - 302 neurons, 118 classes, 5k chemical synapses, 2k neuromuscular junctions, 600 electrical gap junctions
    - Fruit fly:
        - First milestone: imaging and assembly of a complete electron microscopy volume of a Drosophilia larva CNS
        - International effort has used collaborative web-hosted tools to progressively reconstruct the morphology and connectivity of the 2.5k neurons in the first instar larval brain, a process that is now (2022) complete
        - This 10-year gap emphasizes the distinction between completing the imaging of a volume suitable for generating a connectome and the process of extracting and analysing this complete connectivity information
        - Nevertheless, the intervening years saw many studies selectively reconstructing brain-spanning circuits, shedding light on processes including learning and memory and action selection

        - Two large efforts in adult fly brain connectomics were also taking place at Janelia
            1. High-throughput bersion of serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM)
                - 130k neurons
                - 200 meters of neuronal wires / cable in the adult fly brain
                - Complete reconstruction of the whole brain: 2k person-years
            2. FlyEM project team used a different technique -- focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)
                - Imaged roughly half of the central brain of Drosophila
                - 25k neurons
                - Automated segmentation technique followed by 50 person-years of manual proofreading to fix errors
                - Released: hemibrain, the largest complete connectome to date

                - End users can query connectivity between their favorite neurons in seconds over the web
    - Vertebrate connectomics:
        - Early work: studies on sensory structures like retinal circuits in the eye, through which information enters the brain, or motor neurons which control the muscles
        - Important insights gained:
            - Disproved that physical proximity between neurites can predict excitatory connectivity
        - Long-range projections in these datasets are truncated
        - Mammalian neuroscientists have successfully combined functional data w/EM
        - This powerful correlative mutlimodal imaging approach: functional connectomics
The connectomics pipeline
    - Sample preparation: extraction and fixation of the brain
        - Heavy metal staining to provide contrast
        - Physical sectioning
    - Imaging:
        - Must resolve individual synapses and trace membrane-bound neurites which require very high resolution: 10nm or smaller
        - Only vEM can achieve this
        - Work can be spread across multiple microscopes, this step is slow (weeks -> months even for small volumes)
        - Potential pitfalls: exact imaging technique... loss of tissue sections is always a problem
    - Registration:
        - Taking the small 2d image tiles produced during imaging and aligning them to a cohesive, 3d volume
        - Thin sections can stretch/fold
    - Segmentation:
        - of neurites and predict synaptic contacts
    - Analysis:
        - Maximising utility of connectomes
        - Annotation can group neurons with related functions and assign cell types that have previously been reported in the literature
The connectomics community
    - Stakeholders:
        - Wiring diagrams will provide an invaluable resource to understand how neuronal circuits operate
        - The first impact: research that can clearly link brain function/structure to an input or output

        - Replicates may be necessary to understand circuit steretypic patterns across individuals, and larger experimental cohorts might be necessary to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the pathologies that depend on circuit deficits--connectopathies--as well as other disease-focused studies addressing eg. neurodegen, cancer, mental health, ageing...

        - Cell atlas consortia (Human Cell Atlas project) wish to increase their depth of information to the organelle and membrane structure level


Value proposition and challenge
Value
    - Lessons from invertebrates:
        - Synaptic wiring diagrams are a necessary, but insufficent resource for understanding brain function
    - The mouse brain: a blueprint for mammalian connectomes
        - Terrestrial mammal and common disease model
        - Human brains are 3000x larger and will likely remain off limits to connectomics for several decades
    - Whole brain added value: principal neurons extend their processes through vast regions, making it extremely difficult to understand neuronal citcuits entirely from local circuit reconstruction
Challenge
    - Scale
        - The fundamental challenge in mapping a whole mouse brain connectome lies in the size of the sample, about 500 mm^3
        - 3 OOMs larger than the 1 mm^3 which represents the current demonstrated limit for vEM technology
        - Most obvious constraint: human labor required to proofread the mouse connectome

        - Imaging should be no coarser than 1000 nm^3 per voxel
    - Time and cost
        - Estimated cost for a mouse connectome using current technologies:
            - Imaging: A single multibeam SEM can image ~5mm^3 at 10nm resolution per year
                - To image the 500 mm^3 of the mouse brain in 5 years would require 20 microscopes
                - $5m per machine -> upfront cost of $100m plus $100-200m operational costs over the course of 5 years
            - Registration and segmentation:
                - Cloud compute costs: $300-400m
            - Proofreading:
                - $20k per year per proofreader -> $6b-$20b total for proofreading alone!!!!!!
