Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile human cerebral cortex

28 Oct 2016

Abstract
    - The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex collectively known as the "semantic system"
    - However, little of the semantic system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most regions is unknown
    - Here we systematically map semantic selectivity across the cortex using voxel-wise modeling of fMRI data collected while subjects listened to hours of narrative stories

    - We show that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns that appear consistent across individuals
    - We then use a novel generative model to create a detailed semantic atlas

    - Most areas within the semantic system represent information about specifc semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and our atlas shows which domains are represented in each area


Introduction
    - There are a group of regions that seem to represent info about the meaning of language
        - These regions respond more to words than non-words
        - More to semantic tasks than phonological tasks
        - More to natural speech than temporally scrambled speech
    - Studies have investigated specific types of representation in the semantic system have found areas selective for concrete or abstract words

    - Dataset: Seven subjects listened to >2 hours of stories from The Moth Radio Hour, while whole-brain blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses were recorded via fMRI
    - We used voxel-wise modeling (VM) to model responses to complex natural stimuli, to estimate the semantic selectivity of each voxel
