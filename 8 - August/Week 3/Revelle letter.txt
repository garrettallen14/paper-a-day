Abstract
    - Pollutants only increasing
    - We need increased research in a variety of specific areas: soil pollution, effects of air pollutants on man


Introduction
    - The production of pollutants / increasing need for pollution management are an inevitable concomitant of a technological society with a high standard of living
    - Pollutants remaining in our environemnt impair our economy and quality of life

    - Pollutants have altered on a global scale the CO2 content of the air and the lead concentrations in ocean waters and human populations


The Effects of Pollution
Health Effects
    - Excessive air pollution for short periods
    - Prolonged exposure to urban air pollution
    - Water-borne pollutants and health
        - Water treatment often applies to adequately control most disease-producing bacteria
        - Viruses remain a problem
        - Chemical pollutants threaten human health
    - Pesticides and human health
        - Chlorinated hydrocarbon and phosphate ester pesticides have been detected in many surface and ground waters, in amounts ranging up to a few parts per billion
Effects on Other Living Organisms
    - Living things have a capacity for absorption and decomposition of pollutants, with resulting purification of air, water and soil
    - Many species of organisms, each with their own particular range of sensitivity to each pollutant, stand as ready-made systems for environmental bioassay and monitoring, and for warnings of danger to man and environment

    - Living things are independent and interacting, they form a complex, dynamic system
    - Tampering with this system may be desirable and necessary, as in agriculture, which involves artifical manipulation of the balances of nature on a huge scale...
Kinds of effects on organisms other than man
    - Pollution can produce effects subtle to not be notices
    - Sulfur dioxide in stack fumes kills trees and crop plants
    - Domestic sewage and animal wastes can act as fertilizers -- stimulating growth of algae, but creating unfavorable conditions for game fish

    - Heating of rivers and lakes by return of waters used to cool industrial processes or power plants can favor some living forms and devestate others
    - Sediments released into streams or lakes can reduce the supply of light for plants, and smother fish eggs and other useful forms

    - The effects of pollution on livestock and crop plants often show up clearly -- wild forms are much less likely to be detected & are harder to measure

    - Effects of pollutants on living things are complicated and seldom well understood
    - Organisms are subjected to many different pollutants at the same time, pollutants that may enhance one another, partially compensate for one another, or act side by side

    - Pollutants tend to reduce the numbers of species, and to make the relationships of those that remain less stable


Impairment of Water and Soil Resources
Excess fertility in waters
    - Many streams, lakes and estuaries in the US have received such large quantities of mineral nutrients, originating in sewage or domestic animal wastes, that they have become filled with objectionable growths of algae and other water plants

    - Deteriorate water quality, making it unsatisfactory for domestic, industrial and recreational uses

    - In rivers, pollution from excessive nutrients is most common below the waste discharge points of large cities
        - Nitrates and phosphates derived from human and animal wastes, detergents, and agricultural fertilizers are the most noticeable causes of overfertilization of waters, though other nutrients may be important
Soil pollution
    - Impairs the yield or the quality of farm products, and can contribute to subsequent air or water pollution

    - Long-term pollution of soils has resulted from repeated application of copper, arsenic, or lead in insecticides, fungicides or fertilizers:
        - Orchard soils have been destroyed

    - Chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, such as DDT, dieldrin and endrin can also accumulate in the soil
        - Life span is shorter than that of metals, very low levels in a few years or at most in one or two decades

    - Herbicides may persist in the soil and injure crops months or even years after application
    - Long-term losses of soil usefulness are not likely
    - The concentration of salt in river waters used for irrigation is increased by evaporation from reservoirs, canals, watercourses, ditches, and irrigated fields, and frequently also by the inflow of salty tributaries or groundwaters, often to the point where the water becomes hazardous


Polluting Effects of Detergents
    - Synthetic detergents has caused foaming and overfertilization
    - Can give rise to obnoxious algal blooms
    - Most are now degradable


Deterioration of Materials and Urban Environments
    - Airborne soot deposited on buildings, clothing and automobiles, raises maintenance costs by necessitating frequent cleaning and makes our lives more dingy / depressing
    - Hydrogen sulfide darkens paint
    - Sulfur oxides accelerate the weathering of buildings and statues


The Sources of Pollution
    - Deliverate disposal of wastes is more / less systematized activity now
    - Most wastes are not toxic, although they may carry disease
    - Odors, excess fertility of waters, and offenses against natural beauty are widespread
Municipal and Industrial Sewage
    - 2/3 of the US population are served by domestic sewers
    - 1/10 of sewage is discharged raw and 1/4 only primary treatment
Animal Wastes
Urban Solid Wastes
Mining Wastes
Consumer Goods Wastes
Unintentional Releases


In Which Directions Should We Go?
Recommendations:
Principles
    - The public should come to recognize individual rights to quality of living, as expressed by the absence of pollution, as it has come to recognize rights to education, ...
    - Responsibility of each pollutor should be effectively recognized and generally accepted... no "right" to pollute
    - ...
    - All concerned should recognize the quality of human life and the presence and growth of other living things as the major values currently damaged by pollution
    - We must consider our balances and choices within successively larger and more complex systems
    - Each department or agency having responsibility for both enforcement and research in pollution should provide administrative and budgetary separation sufficient to minimize interference between its research and development activities on the one hand, and its investigative and enforcement on the other

    - Filling in of shallow waters essential in life cycles of fishes and shellfish should be regarded as an important kind of pollution
    - Unnecessary use of pesticides should be avoided whenever possible
