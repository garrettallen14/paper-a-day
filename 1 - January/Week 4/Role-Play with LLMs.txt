Role-Play with Large Language Models

25 May 2023

Abstract
- We must develop ways to describe dialogue Agent's behavior in high-level terms without falling into anthropomorphism
- In this paper, we foreground the concept of role-play
- Casting dialogue agent behavior in terms of RP allows us to draw on familiar folk psychological terms, without ascribing human characteristics to LMs
- Two imporant cases of dialogue agent behavior are addressed here:
1. (apparent) deception
2. (apparent) self-awareness


Introduction
- The conceptual framework we use to understand other humans is ill-suited to LLM-based dialogue agents
- We need an alternative conceptual framework, a new set of metaphors that can productively be applied to these exotic mind-like artefacts
- Propose two basic metaphors:
1. A dialogue agent as Roleplaying a single character
2. A dialogue agent is a superposition of simulacra within a multiverse of possible characters.


Dialogue Agents and Role-Play
- The love triangle is a familiar trope, so a suitably prompted dialogue agent will begin to role-play the rejected lover. 
- Likewise, a familiar trope in science-fiction is the rogue AI system that attacks humans to protect itself. 
- A suitably prompted dialogue agent will begin to role-play such an AI system.
